* Periods are now appended to all citation types including Blog Posts. This was added after discussion with Ridley staff, and better allows for multiple references to be included in a citation. References are separated by a semi-colon without a period. Fixes #5.
* Subsequent citations referencing the same page of a source will now display the page number. While the SBL citation style treats this differently, Ridley have expressed a preference for always displaying page numbers. Fixes #3.
