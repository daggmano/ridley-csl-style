# Ridley CSL Style [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/daggmano/ridley-csl-style.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/daggmano/ridley-csl-style)

This project provides a CSL style suitable for Ridley College.  It is based on the Society of Biblical Literature (2nd Edition, full note) style, but with tweaks
to better match Ridley's specification.

## Running Tests ##
